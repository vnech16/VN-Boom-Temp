% Ply Rating            The term “Ply Rating” is used to identify a given tire with its maximum 
%                       recommended load when used in a specific type of service. It is an index 
%                       of tire strength and does not necessarily represent the number of carcass plies in the tire. 
% TT or TL              Designates whether the tire is tube-type or tubeless construction 
% Rated Speed           The maximum speed, normally in miles per hour, to which the tire is qualified. 
% Rated Load            The maximum load rating in pounds. 
% Rated Inflation       The inflation pressure required for the tire to support the rated load. 
% Max Braking Load      The maximum steady braking load which may be applied to a tire. 
% Max Bottoming Load    Approximate load required to bottom the tire on the rim at rated inflation pressure. 
% Part Number           The Goodyear part number assigned to the tire if applicable. 
% Inflated Dimensions   The dimensions of a new tire inflated to rated inflation pressure. 
% Static Loaded Radius  The distance from the center of the axle to the deflected tread surface under 
%                       normal load and inflation pressure. 
% Flat Tire Radius      The distance from the center of the axle to the deflected tread surface when 
%                       subjected to bottoming load. 
% Aspect Ratio          The ratio of tire section height to tire section width. 
% Wheel                 The dimensions of the wheel on which the tire is to be used. 
% LST                   Load, speed, and time curve. 
% SCD                   Specification Control Document. 
% T&RA                  The Tire and Rim Association 
% U                     Universal LST Curve (TSO-C62e) 
% DT                    Deflector Type. (Nosewheel chine) 
% DDT                   Dual Deflector Type
